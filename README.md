# Jupiter

*Jupiter* is a master piece of computer music, for flute and live electronics, composed during 1986-7 by Philippe Manoury with Miller Puckette, at Ircam (Paris) [1]. The code of the electronic production is available via a project called *Pure Data Repesitory Project*, thanks to Miller Puckette, downloadable here [msp.ucsd.edu/pdrp/latest/](http://msp.ucsd.edu/pdrp/latest/)

This repositiry include three programs I have made during my PhD [2] for analyzing *Jupiter*. The goal of them is to represent the routing of the electronic production, *i.e.* all the connection between the modules which takes place during the half an hour of this musical work.
